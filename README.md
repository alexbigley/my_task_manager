#My Task Manager Application

This project is a simplistic web application for scheduling and prioritizing tasks on a to-do list, coded using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Users can enter in as many tasks as they desire in the text bar on the top of the screen, as well as assign a due date and a priority to each task, in order to ensure that the most important objectives can be completed first. Once they are done with that, the task will automatically be added to a queue at the bottom of the page, along with a checkmark button that will cross it out whenever the task has been completed. With a highly-accessible interactive interface such as this, prioritizing one's daily or weekly activities will be considerably less stressful.

##Features Include:
- **Due Date Tracking System**
- **Priority Ranking**
- **Task Addition and Completion**
- **Automatic Error Detection**
